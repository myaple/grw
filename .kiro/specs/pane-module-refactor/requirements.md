# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the pane module in a Rust application to improve maintainability by extracting individual pane implementations from a monolithic mod.rs file into separate files while preserving the existing public API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each pane implementation to be in its own file, so that the codebase is more maintainable and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pane module is refactored THEN each pane struct and its implementation SHALL be moved to its own file
2. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the following panes SHALL each have their own file:
   - AdvicePanel
   - FileTreePane  
   - MonitorPane
   - DiffPane
   - SideBySideDiffPane
   - HelpPane
   - StatusBarPane
   - CommitPickerPane
   - CommitSummaryPane
3. WHEN each pane is extracted THEN all associated structs, enums, and implementations SHALL be moved together

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the public API of the pane module to remain unchanged, so that existing code continues to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all public exports from the pane module SHALL remain the same
2. WHEN the mod.rs file is updated THEN it SHALL re-export all pane types and traits
3. WHEN external code imports from the pane module THEN it SHALL continue to work without changes
4. WHEN the PaneRegistry is used THEN it SHALL continue to function with all panes available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared types and traits to remain accessible, so that panes can continue to interact properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shared types are identified THEN they SHALL remain in mod.rs or be moved to a shared module
2. WHEN the Pane trait is used THEN it SHALL remain accessible to all pane implementations
3. WHEN common enums like PaneId and AppEvent are used THEN they SHALL be accessible from the module root
4. WHEN panes need to reference shared data structures THEN they SHALL have proper access through imports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module structure to be logical and consistent, so that it's easy to find and work with specific panes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pane files are created THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention (snake_case matching the struct name)
2. WHEN imports are organized THEN they SHALL be clean and minimal in each file
3. WHEN the mod.rs file declares submodules THEN it SHALL use a clear and organized structure
4. WHEN documentation exists THEN it SHALL be preserved during the refactoring
