i would like to add a pane to the tool. it should take over the entire screen. it is called the advice panel. when a user presses ctrl + l it should open the advice pane. it should have a dynamic help page activated with ? that details all of the navigation and hotkeys and all. i want the same navigation keys as the other panes. in this pane, i want it to take a configuration for an llm called advice_llm_model, building off the config for llm that is already there. as soon as the pane is opened, i want it to send a request to the llm with the entire diff of the current working directory or commit chosen, and ask for 3 actionable improvements to the code. then, when the user presses / it should open up a small chat line where the user can send follow up queries to the llm and receive back the response.
